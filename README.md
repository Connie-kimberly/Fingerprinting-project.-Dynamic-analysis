# Fingerprinting-project.-Dynamic-analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to detect fingerprinting behavior in webpages through dynamic analysis of JavaScript execution traces. Using a dataset of 1 million websites, we analyze a subset of 4,000 instances to identify suspicious activities. The detection process involves collecting script execution traces using OpenWPM, extracting features, and applying machine learning classification techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of source code from 1 million websites, with a focus on 4,000 selected for in-depth analysis. This dataset is instrumental in identifying and categorizing JavaScript fingerprinting techniques into four classes: Canvas, Audio, FontCanvas, and WebRTC.
